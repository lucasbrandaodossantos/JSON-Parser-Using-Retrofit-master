# JSON-Parser-Using-Retrofit
A simple Json parser using retrofit library

The first commit i have 2 examples to parse this json file:

- The example 1 use no libraries to parse, just AsyncTask method, called ParseJson.

- The example 2 use Retrofit library to call the GET response.

The last commit is just to remove the example 1 code-comments.
